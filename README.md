# [GPUI Book](https://matinaniss.github.io/gpui-book/)

A book teaching you the concepts you need to create your own [GPUI](https://www.gpui.rs/) application.

## Building

This book utilises [`mdBook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), a tool to create modern, easy-to-navigate books from Markdown files. You will need to install their CLI tool to build the book locally.

```properties
mdbook build
```
